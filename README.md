# KiCad-Color-Flags
Color flags for use with global labels in KiCad schematics

## Description
While drafting schematics with complex subsystem interactions, it can be difficult to quickly identify both ends of a global label. These flags can be used to color code those labels within a KiCad Schematic. There are square and pointed flags that can be used either inside or outside of those labels, with 40 mil or 50 mil text size.

## Use
- Download the KiCad Color Flags zip file from this repository. 
- Unzip into a convenient location.
- Create a global label within your KiCad schematic. Ensure the text size is either 0.040 or 0.050 inches in size.
- Click the "Add Bitmap Image" tool.

- Select the color, size and shape of the flag you want to use. If using a pointed flag, indent the label text by a few spaces to expose the flag fully.

Flags named "flag_xx" are square. Flags named "full_flag_xx" are designed to nest inside the pointed end of the global label.
